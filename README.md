# MOP code editor
A toy project intented to some day resemble a text editor.

## building
Hopefully just run `build.sh` or `build.bat` depending on your OS.
<br>
Dependencies:
 - SDL2 (Included in Windows)
 - C compiler (clang or gcc on linux and mingw on windows)
 - Bash (on linux)

## Issues
 - Only supports ASCII characters.

## License
All code written for the editor is in the public domain.
I did not write SDL2 which is under the zlib-license or the STB libraries which are also in the public domain.
